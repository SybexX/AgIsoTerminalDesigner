## Current Status

This project is under **active development**. While some features may not yet be fully supported or fully compliant with AEF standards, improvements are ongoing.

### Features

- [Web version](https://open-agriculture.github.io/AgIsoTerminalDesigner/) for easy access
- Load and save object pools from/to files
- Navigate through the object pool tree
- Use hyperlinks to navigate to referenced objects
- Render active mask and current selection in a preview window
- Limit selecting macro's and object references to allowed types only.

### What's Next

The list below outlines some of the features and improvements that are planned to be implemented in the future. The order is a good indication of the priority.

- Add the remaining objects for configuration and rendering.
- Display a preview of the active soft key mask.
- Allow changing VT version and adjust object pool configuration/rendering accordingly.
- Implement the ability to give objects custom names.
- Add a colour picker for colour attributes.
- Add a search bar to quickly find objects.
- Show a pop-up when creating a new object for initial configuration.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

### Supported Objects

The lists below only apply to version 3 of the VT specification. There are 3 stages of development for each object: **Not Started** [ :white_circle: ], **In Progress** [ :yellow_circle: ], and **Completed** [ :green_circle: ]. Open an issue if you would like to prioritize a specific object, or even better, submit a pull request to help implement it!
